# 🏠🔒 IoT Anomaly Detection Using Machine Learning Techniques

Harness the power of Machine Learning to secure IoT environments by identifying suspicious behavior in real-time — protecting your smart devices from unseen threats.


## 📚 Abstract

The proliferation of smart homes has led to widespread adoption of interconnected Internet of Things (IoT) devices, offering enhanced convenience and automation. However, this connectivity introduces substantial security challenges, as IoT devices remain prime targets for cyberattacks. 

This project introduces a robust anomaly detection system powered by machine learning to proactively identify malicious activities within smart home networks. Leveraging the comprehensive **BoT-IoT dataset**, which mirrors real-world IoT botnet traffic, our system is trained and evaluated to ensure high reliability.

**Key Highlights:**
- Utilizes advanced machine learning algorithms:
  - 🌳 Random Forest
  - 🌲 Decision Tree
  - 🚀 AdaBoost
  - 🧠 Artificial Neural Network (ANN)
  - 🕸️ LSTM
  - 💡 Autoencoder
- Evaluates performance using critical metrics: **Weighted Precision, Recall, and F1 Score**.
- Effectively detects various attack types, including data exfiltration, keylogging, and service scanning.

The results demonstrate that machine learning models can significantly improve the security of smart home environments by:
- Detecting network anomalies in real-time
- Providing immediate alerts to users 
- Enhancing overall safety and privacy

This approach serves as a practical and scalable method to fortify current and future smart home deployments against evolving cyber threats.
