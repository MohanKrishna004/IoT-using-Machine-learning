##  ABSTRACT

Smart homes increasingly rely on interconnected Internet of Things (IoT) devices, offering 
convenience and automation but raising significant security concerns. These devices are 
vulnerable to various cyberattacks, making security a critical challenge. A machine learning 
based anomaly detection system is proposed to identify malicious activities in smart home 
networks. The system leverages the BoT-IoT dataset, a comprehensive benchmark dataset 
reflecting real-world IoT botnet traffic, for training and evaluation.  
Metrics like Weighted Precision, Recall and F1 score are compared and machine learning 
algorithms are utilized, namely Random Forest, Decision Tree, AdaBoost, Artificial Neural 
Network (ANN), LSTM, and Autoencoder. These algorithms effectively identify a variety of 
attacks, including data exfiltration, keylogging, and service scanning, highlighting their 
reliability in safeguarding smart home systems. 
The findings underscore the potential of machine learning to enhance smart home security by 
detecting anomalies and providing timely alerts to improve user safety and privacy. The 
approach serves as a practical method to strengthen the security of current and future smart 
home deployments, providing a robust layer of defence against emerging threats.
